# Machine Learning Process

Welcome to the machine learning process courselet. In this courselet, you will learn the fundamental process to build a machine learning model, from the acquisition of the data, through deployment. This courselet is meant to give an introductory foundation of the covered topics. 

We have designed this courselet into 5 modules, representing a 5 step machine learning process. The modules are the following:

* Step 1 - Acquiring Data
* Step 2 - Exploring Data
* Step 3 - Data Preprocessing
* Step 4 - Analysis and Reporting
* Step 5 - Deployment
