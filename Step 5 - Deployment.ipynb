    "# Step 5 - Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "We have reached the final module of our 5 step process. In the previous modules, we focused on the steps of creating a productive model. In this final module, we will focus on the final challenges involved in implementing a ML-based solution. By the end of this module, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify the main aspects to take into consideration when deploying a model\n",
    "* Understand the motivations behind building a machine learning model\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** This is the only module in which we are not going to code. Nonetheless, the reflexion and questions posted here are a crutial component of our ML process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What do we mean by deploying a model? \n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have gone through what we call the *development* phase. In this phase:\n",
    "1. We started by collecting our data, identifying multiple sources and formats in which data can appear. \n",
    "2. We performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find potential errors, inconsistencies, missing values and areas of improvement in our data\n",
    "3. We transformed and prepared our data for modeling\n",
    "4. We defined a model, evaluated it and reported our results\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, it is time to proceed with the deployment part of this process, this means, putting the model into production to generate live results and take action based on those results. This is what we call the *production* phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What should we concern about when deploying a model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing a model is a hard task, and keeping it functional in production is not precisely easier. There are several aspects you should take into consideration when deploying a model. Let's review some of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Production environment** \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, when we develop a machine learning model, we work in what we call the *development environment*, which is the place where we code, test and modify our models until we find the optimal design to solve our problem. Once we define our model, we need to put it into a *production environment*, which is the place where our model works in real time. This raises a series of questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How is the data going to be collected and pre-processed in real time? What kind of API or data collection system we need to set up? \n",
    "- What is the right type of server our model needs? Is it an in-house resource, or a cloud infrastructure as a service (IaaS) resource?\n",
    "- How can we improve the computational performance and scability of our model in the case that the amount of data or number of users increases over time?\n",
    "- Which security systems do we need to set up to protect our application?\n",
    "\n",
    "These are all questions with answers out of the scope of this courselet. However, it is worth giving them attention so you can think about them when working on a project aimed to implement a ML-based solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Monitoring**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we decide to deploy a model, we very likely found it to perform pretty well during the development phase. However, this doesn't mean we should take our model for granted. Remember, our model was developed using a sample of the big universe of data. Again, we can come up with a series of questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What system are we going to use to monitor computational performance of our model?\n",
    "- How are we going to collect and store the results of our model for live evaluation?\n",
    "- Which metrics will better describe the performance of our model?\n",
    "- How are we going to identify potential changes in the input data that might compromise the performance of our model, or might even lead to rethink in how to approach the problem we are solving?\n",
    "- Which techniques are we going to use to optimize the parameters of our model as new data comes?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Documentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "This might be one of the least favorite components of all of this process, but certainly, one of the most important. Before deploying, make sure you have properly documented all of your process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why did you choose the data you're working with?\n",
    "- What kind of data transformation process you went through and why did you take those decisions?\n",
    "- Which performance metrics led you to choose the current model?\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these are questions that could be asked by a future user/contributor of your model (or even by your future self). Therefore, make sure to follow some of the following advices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Leave as many comments as possible through your code.\n",
    "- Document the results you obtain through your exploratory data analysis and your model evaluation.\n",
    "- Make sure to save all of your pieces of code and relevant documents in a system like a GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have gone through the fundamentals of building a machine learning model. But why do we do this? Maybe we should have started with this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "There can be multiple motivations behind our process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Business motivated: Companies are constantly looking to generate solutions that allows them to improve their processes, increase their sales and improve clients experiences. Machine learning can be used to all of this. You can solve problems like identifying which type of ads are more likely to be clicked by users, analyzing the sentiment of the reviews of a product or service your company is offering, or recommending products to clients based on preferences and purchase history. \n",
    "- Policy motivated: Another reason to build a model is to generate a data informed policy decision. Machine Learning can help us with the following questions: Where are crimes more likely to occur based on a series of socioeconomical variables? Can we predict if a congress bill is going to pass by analyzing the wirtten content?\n",
    "- Science motivated: Natural sciences fields benefit a lot from the use of Machine Learning. Questions like \"Is it possible to predict tomorrow's weather?\" or \"Can we predict the spread of a wildfire?\" can be answered through ML modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever your motivation is, the most important part of all of this process, is that you can translate your results and all of your effort into actions that benefit an organization, a community, a business, a field of knowledge, or any other user you can think of. The range of possibilities is up to you. "
